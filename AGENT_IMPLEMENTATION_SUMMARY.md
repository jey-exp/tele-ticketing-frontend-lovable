# Agent Role Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete Agent UI for the Network Ticketing Application with role-based access control. The Agent role allows agents to create tickets on behalf of customers while maintaining all other functionalities similar to the Customer role.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Agent-Specific Create Ticket Page (`AgentNewTicket.jsx`)
- **Customer Selection**: ComboBox component from shadcn/ui for searching and selecting customers
- **Enhanced Form Fields**:
  - Customer search with real-time filtering
  - Issue category with "Other" option that reveals custom category input
  - Sub-category dependent on main category
  - Date picker for issue date
  - Priority selection
  - File attachments (images only)
  - Detailed description
- **Success Modal**: Shows ticket summary including customer name, ticket ID, and SLA duration

### 2. Role-Aware Dashboard (`Dashboard.jsx`)
- Dynamic button text: "Create a Ticket" for Agents vs "Raise a Ticket" for Customers
- Agent-specific statistics based on tickets they created
- Recent activities filtered to show only agent-created tickets

### 3. Enhanced My Tickets Page (`MyTickets.jsx`)
- **Agent View**: Shows tickets created by the agent with customer information
- **Enhanced Search**: Includes customer names in search functionality for agents
- **Dynamic Headers**: "My Created Tickets" for agents vs "My Tickets" for customers

### 4. Updated Ticket Components
- **TicketCard**: Shows customer information for agents
- **TicketDetailModal**: Displays customer details for agent-created tickets

### 5. Enhanced Feedback Center (`Feedback.jsx`)
- Agent-specific feedback filtering (only tickets they created)
- Customer information display in feedback cards and history table
- Role-aware table columns

### 6. Mock Data Enhancements
- **Customer Data** (`mockCustomers.js`): 10 mock customers with complete information
- **Ticket Data Updates**: Added `createdBy` field to distinguish agent-created tickets
- **Helper Functions**: Agent-specific data filtering functions

### 7. Role-Based Routing (`App.jsx`)
- Conditional rendering: AgentNewTicket for agents, regular NewTicket for customers
- Seamless user experience based on role
